https://github.com/Yuvarani2005yuva/Recipe-Book

Introduction
In this project, we'll create a Recipe Book Web App using GitHub API along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application will allow users to browse, search, and save recipes from repositories on GitHub. The GitHub API will be used to fetch recipe data from repositories, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used to create the user interface and functionality.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web pages.
CSS: For styling the web pages.
JavaScript: For implementing interactive features and handling API requests.
GitHub API: For retrieving recipe data from GitHub repositories.
Features
Browse Recipes: Users can browse through a collection of recipes fetched from GitHub repositories.
Search Recipes: Users can search for specific recipes using keywords or categories.
Save Recipes: Users can save their favorite recipes for later reference.
Responsive Design: The web app will be responsive and accessible on various devices.
Implementation Steps
1. Set Up GitHub API Access
